    On March 07, 2019 Red Hat & the JBoss Community announced Quarkus. It is a Java framework that enables ultra low
    boot
    times and tiny
    memory footprint for applications and services. It does that by taking advantage of GraalVM's native compilation
    capabilities to produce an executable out of your Java code. Why is this considered to be a game
    changer ?
    In this article I will give my view and first impressions on this framework as someone who spends
    a bit of time writing applications and services. I will get my hands dirty by building a
    working Quarkus + Apache Camel example.

<h2>What's the big deal about Quarkus?</h2>

<p>When Quarkus was announced 1 week ago, many have commented that this is a game changer for the future of
    Java Application
    Development. I must say that I have rarely been so excited about a project as I am right now for Quarkus !
    So what's the big deal here ?
</p>

<p> The official website quarkus.io states that Quarkus can be qualified as "Supersonic Subatomic Java". It is a "A
    Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries
    and standards".
